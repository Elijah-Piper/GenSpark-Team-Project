# GenSpark-Team-Project
This is a console text-based program containing two seperate utilities, (1) a tool that formats a list of words into aligned columns and (2) a tool that assigns a number of conference talk proposals into specific timeslots. Both utilities take in a single text file as input (the column formatter input file contains each word seperated by a new line and the scheduler input file contains each talk proposal with its length seperated by a new line).

### Collaborators:
* Dylan Romansky
* Michael Cook
* Elijah Piper

## How to Use:
1. A prompt will appear asking which utility is desired, either the column formatter or the scheduler.
** For the column formatter, the user can enter: "1", "cf", "column formatter", "column", "formatter", or "formatting".
** For the scheduler, the user can enter: "2", "s", "scheduler", or "scheduling".
** If the desired utility cannot be determined, the user will be prompted to try again.
2. Another prompt will appear asking the user for the absolute path (file location) for the input text file. (example: C:\Documents\example_input_file.txt)
